# obliviontech.dev

The developer portfolio for @raghav-misra & @LehuyH on Github.

## Tech Used:

The website is a static SPA hosted on Netlify. We used absolutely no frameworks of any kind, and everything is written in Vanilla JS. 

The website was written in TypeScript and to use components in Vanilla JS, we used WC Custom Elements (which are super cool).

I found it really fun to write a fully-fledged site without frameworks of any kind, but likely I wil rewrite it later in Vue.js.

## Status of completion:

### Pages:
 - Home **NOT STARTED**
 - About **NOT STARTED**
 - Projects **Finished** (we need to add more though)
 - Contact **Finished** (tweak look/feel maybe)
